   - Strength(s)
   - Limitation(s)
3. Limit the number of clusters to what fits the word budget (typically 3–5).
4. Gaps must be framed as:
   - structural limitations,
   - methodological trade-offs,
   - or missing evaluation dimensions — not “lack of attention”.
5. The final paragraph must logically justify THIS paper’s approach, not merely assert novelty.

METHODOLOGY-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS:
- If QUANTITATIVE: compare models, metrics, datasets, assumptions, and evaluation practices.
- If QUALITATIVE: compare theoretical lenses, sampling strategies, analytic methods, and interpretive scope.
- If REVIEW paper: this section must define the synthesis framework and classification logic.
